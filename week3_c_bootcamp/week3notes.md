When doing a function, order matters

A function needs to be defined before it is used!!
So you should define the function first

VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT scanf:
you must give a spacebar in scanf when you scan. 
We still dont know why the spacebar is necessary.
But use it because it is safer and it might work
out always. Find out why we need a space.
So, you do:
   scanf(" %x", &label);
   which x could be d, f, c...
   Use a spacebar in the scanf
